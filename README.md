### Hi there, I'm Nadya Audina S Kurnia ðŸ‘‹

  I graduated from Sebelas Maret University majored in Public Administration (GPA 3.64). The main core of the major that I took is being sensitive to problems in
society and how to respond to them as a regulator. 
  I also took Data Science bootcamp at Rakamin Academy and finished Virtual Internship at Kimia Farma. I added some skills such as: SQL, Python, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. I believe these knowledge that I am studying continuously can be used in various fields for now and in the future.
